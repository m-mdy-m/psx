  ## Our Pledge

  We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
  community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
  size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
  identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
  nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
  identity and orientation.

  We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
  diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

  - Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
  - Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
  - Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes

  Examples of unacceptable behavior:

  - The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
  - Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
  - Public or private harassment
  - Publishing others' private information without their explicit permission

  ## Enforcement Responsibilities

  Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
  acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
  response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
  or harmful.

  ## Scope

  This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
  an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

  ## Enforcement

  Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
  reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at {{conduct_email}}.

  All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
